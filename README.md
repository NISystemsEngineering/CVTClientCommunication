# CVT Client Communication (CCC)
In distributed applications using the Current Value Table (CVT) there is a fundamental need to pass CVT data between targets. This tool demonstrates one method of communication between CVT instances on different targets using a TCP/IP client/server protocol.

###The LabVIEW version used for the CCC is 2010. Please ensure that all pull requests use 2010. If you do not have 2010, be sure to use features supported in 2010 -- that is, don't use auto-indexing, async call by ref, or any other features added in the last few years.

The main landing page for the CVT is here:
